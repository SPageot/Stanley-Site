  {
    jobYear: "July 2023 - Present",
    company: "Super Systems Inc/Semper Valens Solutions",
    jobTitle: "Software Engineer",
    jobSummary: `I developed backend servers with FastAPI and NestJS, improving
          performance and security through best practices like rate-limiting and
          authentication verification. I integrated React on the frontend,
          optimizing performance with hooks and reusable components, and reduced
          development time. I tested AI models with FastAPI, implemented
          TypeScript to improve reliability, and documented projects on GitHub
          for better collaboration. I containerized projects with Docker,
          applied security best practices, and used Azure functions for
          scalability. I also optimized state management with Redux, tested with
          Jest and pytest, and worked closely with UX designers and product
          managers to deliver user-friendly interfaces.`,

    jobTitle: "Full Stack Web Developer",
    jobSummary: `I created
          client-side applications with React to reduce development time and
          improve performance and security. I implemented NestJS, FastAPI, and
          GraphQL in various projects, adding security features to prevent
          unauthorized access and limit endpoint pings. I wrote documentation
          for smooth project handovers, containerized projects with Docker for
          consistency across environments, and applied security best practices.
          I also built mobile applications with React Native for cross-device
          consistency and maintained clear communication with clients, walking
          them through each project's development process`,

    jobYear: "Nov 2021 - Oct 2022",
    company: "Chia Network",
    jobTitle: "React Developer",
    jobSummary: `I streamlined
          development by creating reusable React components and implemented
          Redux for efficient state management, improving performance and
          reducing re-renders. I used Jest for client-side testing, minimizing
          errors, and integrated Formik to reduce user input mistakes.
          Collaborating with UI designers and product managers, I translated
          design concepts into functional interfaces and contributed to scalable
          ExpressJS server-side applications. I also conducted code reviews,
          provided feedback on best practices, and suggested UI improvements to
          enhance user experience, all while actively participating in the agile
          development process.`,

    jobSummary: `I implemented
          React Native and React for mobile and web applications, optimizing
          performance to reduce loading times and enhance overall efficiency. By
          integrating Redux for centralized state management, I made debugging
          easier and improved error handling. I decreased development time by
          using Bootstrap and utilized TypeScript to reduce user errors and
          bugs. Additionally, I optimized UI rendering and data fetching for
          better performance and provided valuable UI recommendations to enhance
          the user experience. Completing tasks on time helped accelerate
          production.`,
